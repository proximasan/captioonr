# captioonr
a simple little python GUI to load a folder with images and caption them

---

added a few more features:
- you can navigate with the left and right arrow keys now
- CMD+S or CTRL+S to save, or check "save when moving" to automatically save when... moving
- backup all txt-files of the opened folder to another folder
- find and remove
- find and replace
- removes and replaces for all txt-files btw!
- bigger text box for the caption

if you prefer the more minimal version you can use captioonr_s.py
